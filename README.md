ANA 625 – Categorical Data Methods and Applications

Author: Randall C. Crawford

This repository contains coursework completed for ANA 625: Categorical Data Methods and Applications, a graduate-level course focused on the statistical analysis of categorical response data for knowledge discovery and applied decision-making.

The course emphasized understanding association, confounding, and effect modification in categorical data, with methods developed from contingency tables through generalized linear models, particularly logistic regression. Analytical rigor and correct interpretation of results were central themes throughout the course.

Core topics and skills covered include:

Exploratory analysis of categorical variables and data organization

Construction and interpretation of 2×2 and I×J contingency tables

Pearson chi-square and likelihood-ratio tests for association

Measures of association strength (odds ratios, relative risk)

Confounding and stratified analysis

Binary logistic regression and interpretation of model coefficients

Model fit assessment, diagnostics, and predictive evaluation

Interaction effects and effect modification

Model building strategies for categorical outcomes

Application of categorical methods to real-world case studies

Coursework required applying these techniques using SAS and R, with an emphasis on statistical reasoning, correct use of assumptions, and clear communication of findings.

This repository demonstrates applied competency in categorical data analysis, logistic regression, and statistical inference, aligned with the learning objectives of ANA 625.
