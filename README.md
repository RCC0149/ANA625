# ANA 625 – Categorical Data Methods and Applications

**Author:** Randall C. Crawford

---

## Course Overview

This repository contains coursework completed for **ANA 625**, a graduate-level course focused on the **theory and application of categorical data analysis**. The course provided an in-depth treatment of statistical methods used to analyze **binary, ordinal, and nominal outcomes**, with a strong emphasis on **correct interpretation, model assumptions, and real-world applicability**.

Rather than treating models as black boxes, the course emphasized understanding **why categorical methods work**, how they relate to contingency table analysis, and how they extend naturally into **generalized linear models**.

## Key Topics Covered

* Exploratory analysis of categorical variables
* **2×2 and I×J contingency tables**
* Pearson chi-square and likelihood-ratio tests for association
* Measures of association strength (odds ratios, relative risk)
* Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy
* **Confounding, stratification, and Simpson’s paradox**
* Binary logistic regression and coefficient interpretation
* Model fit assessment and goodness-of-fit diagnostics
* Interaction effects and effect modification
* Model building strategies for categorical outcomes
* Cumulative (ordinal) and multinomial logistic regression

---

## Tools & Methods

* **R and SAS** for categorical data analysis
* Statistical modeling using **logistic and generalized linear models**
* Analytical emphasis on **inference, diagnostics, and interpretation**

---

## Learning Emphasis

Coursework focused on:

* Translating real-world questions into statistically valid models
* Understanding the distinction between **association and causation**
* Evaluating model quality beyond statistical significance
* Communicating results clearly and defensibly

---

## Outcome

This repository reflects applied competency in **categorical data analysis, logistic regression, and statistical inference**, forming a strong foundation for advanced analytics, data science, and machine learning applications involving non-continuous outcomes.
